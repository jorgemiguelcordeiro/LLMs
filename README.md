# Building a Large Language Model from Scratch  

This repository contains the implementation and step-by-step guide for building a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch, following the concepts outlined in the book *Building a Large Language Model from Scratch* by Sebastian Raschka.  

## üìÇ Repository Structure  

This project is divided into five main stages, each corresponding to a key step in developing an LLM:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preparation and Sampling**  
   - Preprocessing large-scale text datasets  
   - Tokenization and vocabulary construction  
   - Data sharding and efficient storage  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **LLM Architecture**  
   - Transformer model structure  
   - Defining the neural network layers  
   - Implementing attention mechanisms  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Pretraining**  
   - Setting up training pipelines  
   - Optimizing loss functions  
   - Distributed training strategies  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Loading of Weights**  
   - Efficient checkpointing  
   - Weight initialization and loading  
   - Handling large-scale model parameters  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Fine-tuning**  
   - Adapting the model for specific tasks  
   - Transfer learning techniques  
   - Evaluating performance on benchmarks
